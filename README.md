## About This Project Repository

[RockRapids](https://GitHub.com/RockRapids) TechExplorerHub repository is a fork of [@wangbin579](https://twitter.com/wangbin579)'s [Enhanced Form MySQL](https://github.com/enhancedformysql) curated collection of high-quality computer science resources. We are huge fans of [@wangbin579](https://twitter.com/wangbin579)'s simple, *no bs* approach and dependable, failure-free, simple repository structure. Our approach will be similar, but our selections will be chosen similarly, but ***more specifically tailored for volunteer developers of the Rock Rapids community app ecosystem*** who want to help us [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) this content since ... *Humans learn best by teaching others and teach best by learning from others.* 

- Learn how authors and other volunteer developers working on the Rock Rapids community app ecosystem think about research papers and why.

- We focus on papers and books that have applicable, real-world applications in our app ecosystem, rather than just academic databases or hypeware.

- Materials will be carefully selected to identify the tightest, most relevant resources for our developers, especially those learning about our system.

- Challenge problems will be based on the most relevant, real-world engineering scenarios, that matter for our community app ecosystem.
