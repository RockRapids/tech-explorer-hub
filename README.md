## About This Project

Tech Explorer Hub is a fork of [@wangbin579](https://twitter.com/wangbin579)'s [Enhanced Form MySQL](https://github.com/enhancedformysql) curated collection of high-quality computer science resources designed specifically for developers who want to:

- Learn how authors think from research papers.

- Unlike academic databases, we focus on papers and books that have real-world applications.

- Materials are carefully selected to identify the best resources for developers.

- Challenge problems are based on real engineering scenarios.
